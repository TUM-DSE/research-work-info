2.  Introduction (~5 pages)
    * Context of the project
    * Motivate the problem
    * Identify and describe the state-of-the-art (most important research work) 
    * Establish the research gap
    * Problem statement
    * High-level approach and design
    * Implementation overview
    * Evaluation overview
    * Impact summary
    * Itemize the key contributions
3.  Background (~5 pages)
    * Identify the necessary background
    * Explain the background info in sufficient details
4.  Overview (~5 pages)
    * Explain the system overview
    * Design goals
    * Explain the system workflow 
    * Identify system components and explain their function
5.  Design (~10 pages)
    * Explain the system design in detail
    * Explain each system component sufficient details
    * Explain workflows using algorithms
6.  Implementation (~5 pages)
    * Explain all low-level implementation level details
7.  Evaluation (~10 pages)
    * Explain the high-level research questions
    * Experimental testbed, benchmarks, methodology 
    * Evaluate the research questions/hypotheses 
8.  Related Work (~5 pages)
    * Organize the related work in major categories
    * First explain all related work in sufficient detail 
    * Also, explain how the related work compares to your own work
9.  Summary and Conclusion (~2 pages)
    * First summarize the overall work
    * Explain the key findings and impact
    * Mention the source code
10. Future Work (~2 pages)
    * Explain the future work


## Structure for the final presentation

The final talk may be structured like this:

1.  Title: Project name, student name, advisor name
2.  Motivation
3.  Research gap
4.  Problem statement
5.  System and design goals
6.  Outline
7.  Overview
8.  Design 
9.  Implementation
10. Evaluation
11. Conclusion

| Guided research   | 10 minutes        | 20 minutes |


## Grading

The overall grade is based on the following three dimensions:

* Thesis work
* Thesis write-up
* Thesis presentation

For grading, the standard TUM grading scheme will be used, i.e., 1.0, 1.3, 1.7,
2.0, ..., 5.0.
