# Thesis/Report guidelines

Please have these guidelines in mind when writing your BSc/MSc **thesis** or Guided research/IDP **report**.


## Template

- **BSc/MSc thesis template**: Please use the following template for writing your thesis: [Thesis template](https://github.com/TUM-Dev/tum-thesis-latex).
Please use the blue TUM logo (`tum-black_alt.pdf`).
- **Guided research/IDP report template**: Please use the following template for writing your report: [Template](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates) 



## Structure for the write-up

The write-up may be structured around the following (thesis) chapters or (report) sections. Please adapt as per
your content:

1.  Abstract 
    * A short summary of the problem statement, key ideas, tangible contributions
    * A paragraph about the impact summary and link to the source code
2.  Introduction
    * Context of the project
    * Motivate the problem
    * Identify and describe the state-of-the-art (most important research work) 
    * Establish the research gap
    * Problem statement
    * High-level approach and design
    * Implementation overview
    * Evaluation overview
    * Impact summary
    * Itemize the key contributions
3.  Background 
    * Identify the necessary background
    * Explain the background info in sufficient details
4.  Overview 
    * Explain the system overview
    * Design goals
    * Explain the system workflow 
    * Identify system components and explain their function
5.  Design 
    * Explain the system design in detail
    * Explain each system component sufficient details
    * Explain workflows using algorithms
6.  Implementation 
    * Explain all low-level implementation level details
7.  Evaluation 
    * Explain the high-level research questions
    * Experimental testbed, benchmarks, methodology 
    * Evaluate the research questions/hypotheses 
8.  Related Work
    * Organize the related work in major categories
    * First explain all related work in sufficient detail 
    * Also, explain how the related work compares to your own work
9.  Summary and Conclusion 
    * First summarize the overall work
    * Explain the key findings and impact
    * Mention the source code
10. Future Work 
    * Explain the future work



## Expected page count

| Type                | Page count |
|---------------------|------------|
| Bachelor's thesis   | 40 - 80    |
| Master's thesis     | 60 - 120   |
| Guided research/IDP | 5-10       |



## Notes on AI

For the write-up:
- We generally **do not allow the use of AI** (Chatbots, AI agents, anything that automates writing) for the write-up.
- We understand that english is not everyones native language and we do not pedantically check for grammar mistakes. Tools that *check* your grammar are allowed ([TUM provides access to grammarly](https://www.digitalisierung.tum.de/en/grammarly-available-for-all-tum-members/)).
- The goal of the thesis/report is to learn how to conduct research and how to write down your findings in a structured manner, not to hand in the required number of pages.

For the implementation:
- Again, we generally do not allow the use of AI in a fully autonomous manner (AI agents).
- We want you to understand the problem space and develop the technical skills needed for a good implementation.
- For sufficiently hard problems or complex tools (both common at our chair) AI will not be able to help you. Write down your problems and ask your advisor for help instead.
- For less technical code (boilerplate, scripts for plotting, etc.) Copilot or similar line-completion tools are allowed.
