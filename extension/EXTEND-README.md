# Extension

- If a student cannot finish their thesis within the stipulated time limit for some unplanned reasons, they should fill an extension form.  

- As per the department guidelines, it is imperative that the student must properly explain their extension request reason in detail (at least half a page).

- The extension form must be submitted to the chair secretary at least 2 weeks in advance before the final thesis submission deadline.
