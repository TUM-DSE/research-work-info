# Extension

- **Purpose:**  If a student cannot finish their thesis within the stipulated time limit for some unplanned reasons, they should fill an extension form (see below).  

-  **Important:** As per the department guidelines (see below), it is imperative that the student must properly explain their extension request reason in detail (at least half a page).

- **Extension form submission and deadline:**  The extension form must be submitted to the chair secretary at least 2 weeks in advance before the final thesis submission deadline.
