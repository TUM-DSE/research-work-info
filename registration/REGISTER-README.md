## Important guidelines

- Given that we have a strict time limit to accomplish a thesis (6 months for MSc and 4 months for BSc), please ensure that you as a student clearly understand the thesis problem statement and scope before the registration. 


- In general, before registering your thesis, it is a good practice to talk to closely work with your thesis advisor to get familiar with the related work. If possible, please briefly bootstrap the work by implementing a strawman design. This will give you a good idea and confidence going ahead with your thesis work.
