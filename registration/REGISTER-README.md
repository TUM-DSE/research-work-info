# Registration

- Thesis registration is allowed on the 15th of every month.

- The student must fill the registration form: [Registration](https://www.in.tum.de/en/current-students/administrative-matters/thesis-guidelines-and-topics/) 

- The form must be submitted to the chair secretary a week before the deadline. 


## Important guidelines

- Given that we have a strict time limit to accomplish a thesis (6 months for MSc and 4 months for BSc), please ensure that the student already understands that thesis problem statement and has implemented a strawman design before the registration.

- In general, please first get familiarized and briefly bootstrap the work. Please talk to your advisor before the registration.
