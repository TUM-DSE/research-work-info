# Registration

## Deadlines 

-  **Thesis registration** is allowed every day of the month.
-  **Guided Research/IDP registration** is allowed *only* at the beginning of each semester.

## Registration

- Step #1: Please update our [active research work database](https://github.com/TUM-DSE/research-work-archive/blob/main/active_research.md).
- Step #2: The research work is officially registered through https://portal.cit.tum.de/. The advisor should create the entry. The system will then ask the student for confirmation. Once both parties have accepted the thesis, it will be reviewed by the administration.

## Duration

After the registration process, the clock starts! The standard stipulated time limit for your research work is as follows:

|                    | Duration   |
|--------------------|------------|
| Bachelor's thesis  | 4 months   |
| Master's thesis    | 6 months   |
| Guided research/IDP| 1 semester |

## Important guidelines

- Given that we have a strict time limit to accomplish your research work (6 months for MSc thesis, four months for BSc thesis, one semester for Guided Research/IDP), please ensure that you clearly understand the problem statement and scope before initiating the registration process.
- In general, before initiating the registration process, working closely with your advisor is a good practice. This would help you get familiar with the related work, problem statement, and scope of your work. Please also briefly bootstrap the work by implementing a "strawman" design. This will give you a very good idea and confidence as we advance.
