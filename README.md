# Research work at [DSE](https://dse.in.tum.de/)

Fork this repository and adapt it to your needs. You should find everything
here that you will need to successfully complete your research work at our
[chair](https://dse.in.tum.de/theses/), i.e., BSc/MSc theses, guided research
(GR) and interdisciplinary projects (IDPs).

**Note:** As part of your BSc/MSc thesis, you will need to submit a *thesis* to
the chair and the department (Pr√ºfungsamt). Whereas, as part of Guided
research/IDP, you will need to submit a *report* only to the chair.

## Where to start

Take a look at the [checklist](checklist.md) to find out what you have to do
for your research work. Overall, you will go through these phases:

* Pre-registration 
* Registration
* Intermediate update
* Final preparation
* Submission
  
## Assessment 

The overall grade is based on the following four dimensions:

* Research work
* Implementation and evaluation
* Thesis/Report write-up
* Presentation
